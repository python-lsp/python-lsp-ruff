# Security Policy


## Supported Versions

We normally support only the most recently released version with bug fixes, security updates and compatibility improvements.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please open a new security advisory with [our GitHub repo's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-ruff/security/advisories/new).
Please be sure to carefully document the vulnerability, including a summary, describing the impacts, identifying the line(s) of code affected, stating the conditions under which it is exploitable and including a minimal reproducible test case.
Further information and advice or patches on how to mitigate it is always welcome.
You can usually expect to hear back within 1 week, at which point we'll inform you of our evaluation of the vulnerability and what steps we plan to take, and will reach out if we need further clarification from you.
We'll discuss and update the advisory thread, and are happy to update you on its status should you further inquire.
While this is a volunteer project and we don't have financial compensation to offer, we can certainly publicly thank and credit you for your help if you would like.
Thanks!
